// IStateEstimator — THE abstraction seam for supporting multiple vehicles.
//
// Every vehicle must produce a VehicleState; they just reach it differently:
//
//   * Hopcopter  -> OnboardEstimator: reads an IImuSource (raw accel/gyro) and
//                   runs onboard fusion (Mahony/Madgwick) to compute attitude.
//
//   * Robosub    -> ExternalEstimator: the VectorNav's EKF already produced the
//                   attitude on the Jetson; this parser copies the fused
//                   solution straight into VehicleState. No onboard fusion.
//
// The Controller, Safety, and Telemetry modules depend ONLY on this interface
// and on VehicleState — they never learn which vehicle they are running on.
// Selection happens once at boot (build flag / Parameter) via a factory.
//
// Timing contract: update() is PULL-BASED and MUST NOT block. The fixed-rate
// loop calls it every tick. If no fresh sample is available (common on the
// async Jetson USB path), the estimator keeps its last state and reports
// healthy() == false once the data has gone stale, which trips Safety.
